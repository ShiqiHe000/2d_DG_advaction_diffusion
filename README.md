## Approximation of wave equation
The basic model of wave propgation is the wave equation. The wave equation is:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\partial&space;^{2}p}{\partial&space;t^{2}}-c^{2}(p_{xx}&plus;p_{yy})=0" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\partial&space;^{2}p}{\partial&space;t^{2}}-c^{2}(p_{xx}&plus;p_{yy})=0" title="\frac{\partial ^{2}p}{\partial t^{2}}-c^{2}(p_{xx}+p_{yy})=0" /></a>

The variable `p` might represent the acoustic pressure and `c` would be the sound speed. In other applications, 
the equation can represent the electric field with `c` corresponding to the speed of light.
